 Psychology Test Survey Sample
-------------------------------
1.Double Click on index.html file.
2.New window will pop out, click on start button to start the test.
3.When the red color turns to green, click on "Click Here" button.
4.The response time will be calculated base on the start time of the green     cue and the time when the user click on the button.
5.All time record will be displayed in the "Record" section on the right-hand   side.

Note:
Since this is a prototyping, different time trails are all hard-coded in the variable cue_remain_time in the index.js file, and the colors are ugly :(
